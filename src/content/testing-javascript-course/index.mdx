Today, I purchased the [TestingJavascript.com](https://testingjavascript.com/)
course from Kent C. Dodds. While I've done a fair amount of testing in my
career, I've heard tremendous things about the course on the twitters. What
follows is an 8-part stream-of-consciousness as I'm going through the course.

Part 1: [Fundamentals of Testing in JavaScript](/blog/testing-javascript-course-fundamentals)  
Part 2: Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications  
Part 3: JavaScript Mocking Fundamentals  
Part 4: Configure Jest for Testing JavaScript Applications  
Part 5: Test React Components with Jest and React Testing Library  
Part 6: Install, Configure, and Script Cypress for JavaScript Web Applications  
Part 7: Use DOM Testing Library to test any JS Framework  
Part 8: Test Node.js Backends
