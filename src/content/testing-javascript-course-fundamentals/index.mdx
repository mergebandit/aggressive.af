  This is part 2 of an
  <a href="/blog/testing-javascript-course">8-part series</a>
  highlighting my takeaways from each of the modules on Kent C. Dodds' excellent
  <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">TestingJavascript.com</a> course.

## Part 1: Fundamentals of Testing in JavaScript

> In this short course, weâ€™ll learn how testing frameworks and assertion
> libraries work by building our own, simple version of each.

### Takeaways

I once contributed (errata whilst it was WIP) to an incredibly ambitious effort
by [Tero Parviainen](https://teropa.info/) called
[Build Your Own AngularJS](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs).
In that effort, you start with `file > new` on `scope.js` and build the entire
AngularJS (1.x) framework.

During that effort, I transitioned my mental model from:

> I know how to write idomatic AngularJS

to:

> I know _why_ all this works, and can now choose the _best_ approach (as
> opposed to the first one I can get to work)

All of that to say ... I'm certain I could have written the naive `expect`
implementation in this module. The fact remains, however, _I had never done so_.
Simply going through this exercise reinforces my current mental model on how
assertion libraries work.
