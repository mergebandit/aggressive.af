# Zoom to MediaLive

This document will serve as living documentation for wiring up Zoom to AWS
MediaLive.

## Zoom Configuration

As described in this
[Zoom KB Article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001777826-Live-Streaming-Meetings-or-Webinars-Using-a-Custom-Service),
the configuration of zoom is very straight forward. You simply have to configure
a custom live streaming service, which ostensibly just points to a MediaLive
channel url?

## MediaLive

Simply put, AWS Elemental Media Live is a live streaming workflow that involves
three systems:

1. A MediaLive `channel` which ingests and transcodes source content
2. One or more `upstream systems` that provide the `source content` (e.g. video)
   to MediaLive -- in our case, this is Zoom's configured LiveStream
3. One or more `downstream systems` that are the destination for the output that
   MediaLive produces

> A typical downstream system consists of an origin service or a packager that
> is connected to MediaLive, a content distribution network (CDN) that is
> downstream of the origin service or the packager, and a playback device or
> website where the users view the content. AWS Elemental MediaPackage is an
> example of an origin service and packager. Amazon CloudFront is an example of
> a CDN.

### Getting Started

To create a MediaLive workflow, you:

1. create one or more `inputs`. The `inputs` describe how `upstream systems` are
   connected to `channels`
2. create a MediaLive `channel` and attach the `inputs` to the channel.
3. configure the `channel` to describe how MediaLive connects to the
   `downstream systems`

`HLS` stands for HTTP Live Streaming `RTP` stands for Real-time Transport
Protocol

## Things to note:

Upstream System: will be a push (presumably) from zoom

Downstream System SD or H.264 (HD)

The AWS Elemental MediaLive console includes a feature that lets a user create a
password parameter in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. The AWS Systems
Manager Parameter Store is used extensively in AWS Elemental MediaLive. I
