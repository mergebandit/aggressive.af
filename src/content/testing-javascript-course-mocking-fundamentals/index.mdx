  This is part 3 of an
  <a href="/blog/testing-javascript-course">8-part series</a>
  highlighting my takeaways from each of the modules on Kent C. Dodds' excellent
  <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">TestingJavascript.com</a> course.

I always appreciate seeing posts on Twitter about other Sr Engineers who made a
"simple" mistake that cost them a bunch of time. As part of my objective to
[learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), the purpose of
this series is to demonstrate how even at the Principle Engineer level, there
are always things to learn -- even about tooling that I use every day.

## Part 3: Mocking Fundamentals

> This module introduces us to the concept of mocking modules - typically used
> during tests to avoid test unreliability and improve the speed of your tests
