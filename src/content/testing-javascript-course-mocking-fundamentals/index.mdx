<Callout>
  This is part 3 of an
  <a href="/blog/testing-javascript-course">8-part series</a>
  highlighting my takeaways from each of the modules on Kent C. Dodds' excellent
  <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">TestingJavascript.com</a> course.

## Part 3: Mocking Fundamentals

> This module introduces us to the concept of mocking modules - typically used
> during tests to avoid test unreliability and improve the speed of your tests

### Takeaways

Similar to what I described in
[part 1](/blog/testing-javascript-course-fundamentals), building some of the
basic abstractions we use in everyday development is tremendously useful:

In particular, I thought it was useful to incrementally transition from
monkey-patching, through an implementation of spyOn, before ultimately arriving
at inline & external mocking.

### Real World Use Cases

I didn't see a lot of great real-world use-cases for actually mocking modules
like this - since we have such mature libraries and abstractions for this
already, but that does not diminish the usefulness of this exercise.

### Final Thoughts

Onward!
