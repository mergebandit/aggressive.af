_This is part 2 of an [8-part series](/blog/testing-javascript-course)
highlighting my takeaways from each of the modules on Kent C. Dodds' excellent
[TestingJavascript.com](https://testingjavascript.com/) course._

The purpose of this series is to I always appreciate seeing posts on Twitter
about other Sr Engineers who made a "simple" mistake that cost them a bunch of
time. As part of my objective to
[learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), the purpose of
this series is to demonstrate how even at the Principle Engineer level, there
are always things to learn -- even about tooling that I use every day.

## Part 2: Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications

> This module introduces us to a variety of tools that analyze our code to help
> identify bugs

### Takeaways

This is the first time I've built an `.eslintrc` file from scratch in ... quite
awhile. I typically pull them from other projects, or use a tool like
[kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts) or
[dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). Some of the highlights
from this module:

1. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the tool in my toolchain that includes
   `use strict` in all my modules
2. The VSCode Eslint plugin has a shortcut (`Cmd + .`) to:

- Fix problems
- Disable rule for this line / file
- Open documentation for this rule

3. Instead of duplicating `.gitignore`, `.eslintignore`, `.prettierignore` etc,
   I can simply use the `--ignore-path .gitignore` flag
4. I wasn't aware that the [Prettier Playground](https://prettier.io/playground)
   existed

### Real World Use Cases

I am working on a project right now that was using
[tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint). As `tslint` is now deprecated (in
favor of [eslint](https://eslint.org/)), I set up an entire end-to-end workflow
for typescript in eslint.
