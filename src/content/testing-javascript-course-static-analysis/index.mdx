<Callout>
  This is part 2 of an
  <a href="/blog/testing-javascript-course">8-part series</a>
  highlighting my takeaways from each of the modules on Kent C. Dodds' excellent
  <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">TestingJavascript.com</a> course.
</Callout>

I always appreciate seeing posts on Twitter about other Sr Engineers who made a
"simple" mistake that cost them a bunch of time. As part of my objective to
[learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), the purpose of
this series is to demonstrate how even at the Principle Engineer level, there
are always things to learn -- even about tooling that I use every day.

## Part 2: Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications

> This module introduces us to a variety of tools that analyze our code to help
> identify bugs

### Takeaways

This is the first time I've built an `.eslintrc` file from scratch in ... quite
awhile. I typically pull them from other projects, or use a tool like
[kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts) or
[dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). Some of the highlights
from this module:

1. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the tool in my toolchain that includes
   `use strict` in all my modules
2. The VSCode Eslint plugin has a shortcut (`Cmd + .`) to:

- Fix problems
- Disable rule for this line / file
- Open documentation for this rule

3. Instead of duplicating `.gitignore`, `.eslintignore`, `.prettierignore` etc,
   I can simply use the `--ignore-path .gitignore` flag
4. I wasn't aware that the [Prettier Playground](https://prettier.io/playground)
   existed
5. ESLint overrides are ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
6. Instead of inlining your `husky` config within your `package.json`, you can
   extract it to a `.huskyrc` file instead. Same for `.lintstagedrc`

### Real World Use Cases

I recently published a blog post on
[migrating from tslint to eslint](/blog/migrating-from-tslint-to-eslint) that
leveraged a slew of goodies from this module.

### Final Thoughts

In the introduction to this [series](/blog/testing-javascript-course), I
highlighted how valuable this course was based solely on how well it introduced
modern tooling to developers. This module, in particular, stood out.
