Today, I purchased the [TestingJavascript.com](https://testingjavascript.com/)
course from Kent C. Dodds. While I've done a fair amount of testing in my
career, I've heard tremendous things about the course on the twitters. What
follows is a stream-of-consciousness as I'm going through the course.

### Fundamentals of Testing in JavaScript

I once contributed (errata while it was a WIP) to an incredibly ambitious effort
by [Tero Parviainen](https://teropa.info/) called
[Build Your Own AngularJS](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs).
In that effort, you start with `file > new` on `scope.js` and build the entire
AngularJS (1.x) framework.

During that effort, I transitioned my mental model from:

> I know how to write idomatic AngularJS

to:

> I know _why_ all this works, and can now choose the _best_ approach (as
> opposed to the first one I can get to work)

All of that to say ... I'm certain I could have written the naive `expect`
implementation in this module, the fact remains _I had never done so_. Simply
going through this exercise reinforces my current mental model on how assertion
libraries work.
